# 🇺🇦 Ridna Mova: Learn Ukrainian the easy way
## 💡 Idea behind the App
I wanted to create the app that can easily teach a new language without too much stress. I decided to create an application that can teach to
pronounce words in Ukrainian, be able to learn how they are written in Ukrainian and be able to memorize words by associating them with pictures.
## 🔧 Technicalities
#### Platform: iOS 🍎
#### Language used: Swift
#### UI Framework: SwiftUI
#### Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
## 📱 Current state of the application
Application is still under development. There are still a few UI issues that need to be resolved before the App becomes available in the App store.
There is also some content being sourced for the game to make it more interactive. It will be completely free, and will become available as soon as 
possible.
